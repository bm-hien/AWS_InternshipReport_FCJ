# Sharing and Feedback

Overall Evaluation
1. Working Environment
The working environment is very friendly and open. However, I think it would be nice to have more games/social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.

2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major
The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

5. Company Culture & Team Spirit
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

6. Internship Policies / Benefits
The company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.

**Suggestions & Expectations**

More specific tasks rather than workshops

Would you like to continue this program in the future?
