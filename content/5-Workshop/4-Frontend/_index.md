## Frontend Hosting and API Integration on AWS
In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy a **frontend web application** on AWS and **connect it to a backend API** hosted via **Amazon API Gateway**.  
This activity combines **frontend hosting** and **API integration**, showing how AWS services can support interactive, serverless web applications.

**Amazon S3** – Stores and serves your static web assets (HTML, CSS, JS).  
**Amazon CloudFront** – Distributes your website globally with HTTPS and low latency.  
**Amazon API Gateway** – Exposes backend API endpoints that your frontend can call.  

This workshop demonstrates how to connect a static website to a backend API through API Gateway, creating a complete **serverless web architecture** that enables real-time data interaction between frontend and backend.
